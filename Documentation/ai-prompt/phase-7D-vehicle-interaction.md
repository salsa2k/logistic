# Phase 7D - Vehicle Interaction

## Overview
Implement comprehensive vehicle interaction system including selection, detailed view, and integration with map display and route tracking.

## Tasks

### Vehicle Selection System
- Implement vehicle selection in vehicles list and map view
- Create vehicle detail view with comprehensive information
- Set up vehicle focus and highlighting across UI components
- Coordinate vehicle selection between different interface elements

### Vehicle Detail Display
- Comprehensive vehicle information modal or panel
- Vehicle specifications, current status, and operational history
- Current route display if vehicle is in transit
- Contract assignment details and progress tracking

### Map Integration
- Vehicle selection highlighting on map view
- Vehicle position tracking and route display
- Real-time vehicle movement visualization
- Vehicle interaction through map clicking

### Route Visualization
- Display planned route for vehicles in transit
- Show progress along route with position indicators
- Highlight route waypoints and potential stops
- Integrate with gas stations and checkpoints on route

### Vehicle Status Interaction
- Interactive vehicle status panels
- Quick actions available based on vehicle state
- Status change notifications and confirmations
- Emergency actions for vehicles in distress

### Multi-Vehicle Management
- Support for managing multiple vehicles simultaneously
- Batch operations for fleet management
- Vehicle comparison tools for decision making
- Fleet overview and summary statistics

### Real-time Updates

└── VehicleActionHandler.cs (interaction processing)
```

### Vehicle Selection Data
```
VehicleSelection:
- SelectedVehicleId: Currently selected vehicle
- SelectionSource: Where selection originated (list, map, etc.)
- SelectionTime: When selection was made
- PreviousSelection: Previous vehicle for navigation
- SelectionContext: Additional selection metadata
```

### Vehicle Detail Information
```
VehicleDetails:
- BasicInfo: Name, type, specifications
- CurrentStatus: Location, fuel, cargo, assignment
- RouteInfo: Current route, progress, ETA
- History: Recent activities and performance
- Statistics: Usage metrics and efficiency data
- Actions: Available operations based on state
```

### Map Integration Points
- Vehicle markers on map with status indicators
- Route lines for vehicles in transit
- Click/touch selection on map markers
- Zoom-to-vehicle functionality
- Real-time position updates

## Dependencies
- Requires Phase 7A-7C (Vehicle Management) for vehicle data
- Requires map system for vehicle positioning
- Integrates with route calculation and movement systems

## Integration Points
- Vehicle management provides vehicle data and status
- Map system displays vehicle positions and routes
- Movement system provides real-time position updates
- Contract system provides assignment information

## Notes

### Vehicle Selection Behavior
- Single click selects vehicle
- Double click opens detailed view
- Selected vehicle highlighted in all interfaces
- Selection persists during interface navigation
- Clear visual feedback for selection state

### Detail View Layout
- **Header**: Vehicle name, type, and current status
- **Location**: Current position and destination
- **Route**: Path visualization and progress
- **Specifications**: Technical details and capabilities
- **History**: Recent activities and performance
- **Actions**: Available operations and quick controls

### Map Interaction
- Vehicle markers scale with zoom level
- Selected vehicle highlighted with special indicator
- Route display toggles with vehicle selection
- Click tolerance for easy vehicle selection
- Smooth camera movement to selected vehicle

### Quick Actions
- **Available Vehicles**: Move, Assign to Contract, View Details
- **Moving Vehicles**: Show Route, Track Progress, Emergency Stop
- **Assigned Vehicles**: View Contract, Cancel Assignment
- **Low Fuel Vehicles**: Refuel, Find Gas Station, Emergency Refuel

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient vehicle position updates
- Optimized route visualization rendering
- Cached vehicle detail data for quick access
- Smooth animations without performance impact

### Real-time Update System
- Vehicle position updates every 5-10 seconds
- Status changes propagated immediately
- Route recalculation when necessary
- Automatic UI refresh without disrupting interaction

### Testing Requirements
- Test vehicle selection across all interface elements
- Verify real-time updates and synchronization
- Test map integration and route visualization
- Validate performance with large vehicle fleets
- Test multi-vehicle selection and operations
