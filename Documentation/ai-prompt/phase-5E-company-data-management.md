# Phase 5E - Company Data Management

## Overview
Implement comprehensive company data management system with save/load integration, real-time updates, and state synchronization across all game systems.

## Tasks

### Company Data Architecture
- Design CompanyManager singleton for centralized company data management
- Create company data structure with all relevant business information
- Implement data validation and integrity checking
- Set up event-driven data change notifications

### Data Structure Implementation
- Company identity information (name, logo, establishment date)
- Financial tracking (current credits, transaction history)
- License management (owned licenses, acquisition dates)
- Business statistics (vehicles, contracts, performance metrics)
- Operational data (visited cities, active territories)

### Save System Integration
- Serialize complete company data for persistent storage
- Handle data versioning for future updates
- Implement data migration strategies
- Ensure atomic save operations for data integrity

### Load System Integration
- Deserialize company data on game startup
- Validate loaded data for corruption or version issues
- Handle missing or invalid data gracefully
- Restore complete company state from save files

### Real-time Data Updates
- Event system for notifying UI of company data changes
- Automatic updates when licenses are purchased
- Credit balance tracking with transaction logging
- Statistics recalculation when game events occur

### Data Synchronization
- Coordinate company data with vehicle management
- Synchronize with contract system for statistics
- Integrate with financial system for credit tracking
- Maintain consistency across all game systems

### Business Metrics Calculation
- Total vehicles owned and their current status
- Completed contracts count and success rate
- Financial performance tracking and trends
- Operational territory and city coverage metrics

## Acceptance Criteria

### Data Integrity
- ✅ Company data maintains consistency across all game systems
- ✅ Save/load operations preserve all company information accurately
- ✅ Data validation prevents corruption and invalid states
- ✅ Transaction logging ensures financial accuracy

### Performance
- ✅ Real-time updates don't impact game performance
- ✅ Data access is efficient for frequent operations
- ✅ Save operations complete quickly without blocking gameplay
- ✅ Statistics calculations are optimized for frequent updates

### System Integration
- ✅ All game systems can access company data reliably
- ✅ Event notifications reach all interested systems
- ✅ Data changes propagate correctly throughout the game
- ✅ Save system maintains complete company state

### Reliability
- ✅ Data corruption detection and recovery mechanisms work
- ✅ Version migration handles older save files correctly
- ✅ Error handling provides graceful degradation
- ✅ Backup and recovery systems function properly

├── CompanyManager.cs (singleton manager)
├── CompanyData.cs (data structure)
├── CompanyStatistics.cs (metrics calculation)
├── CompanyEvents.cs (event definitions)
├── CompanySaveHandler.cs (save integration)
└── CompanyValidator.cs (data validation)
```

### Company Data Structure
```
CompanyData:
- Identity:
  - Name (string)
  - LogoId (int)
  - EstablishedDate (DateTime)
  - CompanyColor (Color)
- Financial:
  - CurrentCredits (decimal)
  - TransactionHistory (List<Transaction>)
  - FinancialStatistics (FinancialMetrics)
- Licenses:
  - OwnedLicenses (List<LicenseInstance>)
  - LicenseHistory (List<LicenseAcquisition>)
- Operations:
  - VisitedCities (HashSet<string>)
  - VehicleCount (int)
  - ContractStatistics (ContractMetrics)
```

### Event System Integration
- CompanyCreditsChanged event for financial updates
- CompanyLicenseAcquired event for license purchases
- CompanyStatisticsUpdated event for metrics changes
- CompanyDataSaved event for save operation notifications

### Statistics Calculation
```
BusinessMetrics:
- TotalVehicles: Count from vehicle management system
- CompletedContracts: Count from contract system
- SuccessRate: Percentage calculation from contract data
- AverageProfit: Mean profit calculation from transaction history
- OperationalCities: Count of visited cities
- BusinessAge: Days since company establishment
```

## Dependencies
- Requires Phase 1C (Data Structures) for base data types
- Requires Phase 1D (Save System) for persistence
- Requires Phase 1E (Load System) for data restoration
- Integrates with all subsequent game systems

## Integration Points
- Save/Load systems handle company data persistence
- Vehicle management provides fleet statistics
- Contract system provides completion metrics
- Financial system processes credit transactions

## Notes

### Data Validation Rules
- Company name must be 3-50 characters
- Credits must be a valid decimal number
- License acquisitions must have valid timestamps
- Statistics must be non-negative integers

### Transaction Logging
- All credit changes logged with timestamp and reason
- Vehicle purchases recorded with details
- License acquisitions tracked with costs
- Contract rewards logged with contract information

### Performance Optimization
- Statistics cached and updated incrementally
- Event batching for multiple simultaneous changes
- Lazy loading for large historical data
- Efficient data structures for frequent access

### Error Recovery
- Data corruption detection through checksums
- Automatic backup creation before major changes
- Rollback mechanisms for failed operations
- Default company creation for corrupted data

### Version Migration
- Schema versioning for company data structure
- Migration paths for data format changes
- Backward compatibility for older save files
- Safe upgrade procedures with backups

### Security Considerations
- Data validation prevents manipulation exploits
- Transaction integrity checks prevent credit duplication
- Save file validation ensures legitimate data
- Error logging for suspicious data patterns

### Testing Requirements
- Test save/load cycle with various company states
- Verify statistics calculations with different scenarios
- Test event system integration and notification delivery
- Validate error recovery with corrupted data
- Performance test with large transaction histories
