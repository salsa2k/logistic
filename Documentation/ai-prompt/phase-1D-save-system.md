# Phase 1D - Save System

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive save system that persists all game state including player progress, vehicle states, contracts, company data, and settings.

## Tasks

### Save System Architecture
- Create SaveManager singleton for centralized save operations
- Design save file structure with versioning support
- Implement data serialization using Unity's JsonUtility or binary serialization
- Set up save file location and naming conventions

### Game State Serialization
- Serialize complete game state including player progress
- Save all vehicle instances with current positions and states
- Persist contract states (accepted, completed, available)
- Store company information (name, logo, credits, licenses)
- Save visited cities and unlocked content

### Settings Persistence
- Save language preferences and unit system settings
- Persist UI preferences and game options
- Store volume settings and other audio preferences
- Save display and graphics preferences

### Auto-Save Implementation
- Implement automatic saving on major game events
- Auto-save when completing contracts
- Auto-save when purchasing vehicles or licenses
- Auto-save on city arrivals and significant progress

### Save File Management
- Create multiple save slot system
- Implement save file validation and corruption detection
- Add save file metadata (creation date, play time, progress)
- Provide save file backup and recovery mechanisms

### Performance and Safety
- Implement asynchronous save operations to prevent frame drops
- Add data validation before saving
- Create atomic save operations to prevent corruption
- Implement save operation feedback for players

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Save Functionality
- ✅ Complete game state can be saved reliably
- ✅ All player progress and achievements preserved
- ✅ Vehicle states and positions accurately saved
- ✅ Contract progress and status properly persisted

### Data Integrity
- ✅ Save files are validated before writing
- ✅ Corruption detection and recovery mechanisms work
- ✅ Save operations are atomic (all-or-nothing)
- ✅ Backup systems prevent data loss

### Performance Requirements
- ✅ Save operations don't cause noticeable frame drops
- ✅ Asynchronous saving works smoothly
- ✅ Memory usage during saves is reasonable
- ✅ Save file sizes are optimized

### User Experience
- ✅ Auto-save provides seamless experience
- ✅ Manual save options available when needed
- ✅ Save progress feedback shown to player
- ✅ Multiple save slots support different game sessions

## Technical Notes

### Save File Structure
```
SaveData/
├── GameState.json (or .dat)
├── PlayerProgress.json
├── VehicleStates.json
├── ContractStates.json
├── CompanyData.json
├── Settings.json
└── Metadata.json
```

### Serialization Strategy
- Use Unity's JsonUtility for human-readable saves (development)
- Consider binary serialization for performance (production)
- Implement version compatibility for future updates
- Handle data migration between game versions

### Auto-Save Triggers
- Contract completion
- Vehicle purchase
- License acquisition
- City arrival
- Settings changes
- Game exit

### Performance Considerations
- Use coroutines or async/await for save operations
- Serialize data on background threads when possible
- Compress save files if they become large
- Implement save file caching for frequently accessed data

## Dependencies
- Requires Phase 1A (Basic Unity Setup) for GameManager
- Requires Phase 1C (Data Structures) for serializable data types
- Will be used by Phase 1E (Load System)

## Integration Points
- GameManager coordinates save operations
- All game systems trigger saves on state changes
- Settings system persists preferences through save system
- Load system will read files created by this system

## Notes

### Security Considerations
- Implement basic save file validation
- Consider encryption for competitive features (if any)
- Prevent easy save file manipulation for game balance
- Backup important progress markers

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of disk space issues
- Recovery from partial saves
- User notification of save failures
- Fallback to previous save if current save fails

### Platform Considerations
- Use appropriate save locations for each platform
- Handle platform-specific file system limitations
- Consider cloud save integration for future updates
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility if needed

### Debugging and Development
- Implement save file inspection tools for development
- Add logging for save operations
- Create test scenarios for save system validation
- Document save file format for team reference
