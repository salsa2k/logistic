## Overview
Create a connected road network system linking all cities with realistic routes, speed limits, and pathfinding support for vehicle navigation and contract routing.

## Tasks

### Road Network Architecture
- Design connected road system linking all 10 cities
- Create road segment data structure with properties and constraints
- Implement pathfinding algorithm for route calculation
- Set up road network serialization for save system integration

### Road Generation System
- Auto-generate roads between cities at game initialization
- Create realistic road layouts with curves and intersections
- Assign appropriate speed limits to different road segments
- Generate road metadata for navigation and gameplay systems

### Road Properties and Attributes
- Speed limits ranging from 80-110 km/h as specified
- Road difficulty and condition factors
- Distance calculations for fuel consumption and time estimation
- Road type classification (highway, arterial, local)

### Pathfinding Implementation
- Implement A* or Dijkstra algorithm for optimal route finding
- Consider distance, speed limits, and road conditions in routing
- Support for multiple route options (fastest, shortest, most economical)
- Dynamic route recalculation when conditions change

### Network Connectivity Validation
- Ensure all cities are reachable from all other cities
- Validate network integrity and connectivity
- Handle edge cases and isolated network segments
- Provide fallback routes for network issues

### Road Visualization System
- Road rendering on map with appropriate styling
- Visual distinction between different road types
- Route highlighting for active vehicle paths

### Road Segment Data
```
RoadSegment:
- ID: Unique segment identifier
- StartCity: Origin city connection
- EndCity: Destination city connection
- Distance: Length in kilometers
- SpeedLimit: Maximum speed (80-110 km/h)
- RoadType: Highway, arterial, or local
- Condition: Road quality factor (0.5-1.0)
- Waypoints: Intermediate points for curves
- TrafficDensity: Congestion factor
```

### Network Generation Algorithm
1. Position cities on map with realistic spacing
2. Connect each city to nearest 2-3 cities
3. Ensure minimum connectivity (all cities reachable)
4. Add additional connections for network redundancy
5. Generate waypoints for curved road segments
6. Assign speed limits based on road type and length
7. Validate complete network connectivity
8. Optimize network for performance and gameplay

### Pathfinding Implementation
```
PathfindingAlgorithm:
- Algorithm: A* with custom heuristics
- CostFactors: Distance, time, fuel consumption
- Heuristic: Euclidean distance with speed factor
- RouteTypes: Fastest, shortest, most economical
- Constraints: Vehicle capabilities, license requirements
```

## Dependencies
- Requires Phase 8A (2D Map Foundation) for city positioning
- Requires Phase 1C (Data Structures) for road data definitions
- Requires Phase 1D (Save System) for network persistence

## Integration Points
- Map foundation provides city positions for network generation
- Vehicle movement system uses roads for navigation
- Contract system uses pathfinding for route planning
- Save system persists road network state

## Notes

### Road Network Design Principles
- **Realism**: Roads follow logical geographic patterns
- **Connectivity**: Every city reachable from every other city
- **Variety**: Multiple route options for major connections
- **Performance**: Efficient pathfinding and rendering
- **Scalability**: System supports additional cities in future

### Speed Limit Assignment
- **Highways**: 100-110 km/h for long-distance connections
- **Arterial Roads**: 80-90 km/h for medium connections
- **Local Roads**: 80 km/h for short city connections
- **Special Zones**: Reduced speeds near cities or hazards

### Road Type Classifications
- **Highway**: Direct connections between major cities
- **Arterial**: Secondary connections with moderate capacity
- **Local**: Short connections and city access roads
- **Special**: Unique roads with specific gameplay features

### Pathfinding Optimization
- Pre-calculated distance matrices for common routes
- Cached pathfinding results for repeated calculations
- Hierarchical pathfinding for long-distance routes
- Dynamic optimization based on current conditions

### Network Validation Rules
- Minimum two routes between any pair of cities
- No isolated city segments or dead ends
- Maximum route length constraints for gameplay balance
- Alternative route availability for major connections

### Performance Considerations
- Level-of-detail rendering for road segments
- Efficient data structures for pathfinding operations
- Culling of off-screen road segments
- Optimized update cycles for dynamic elements

### Testing Requirements
- Test pathfinding between all city pairs
- Verify network connectivity and redundancy
- Test route calculation performance with large networks
- Validate save/load integration for road data
- Test visual rendering at different zoom levels
