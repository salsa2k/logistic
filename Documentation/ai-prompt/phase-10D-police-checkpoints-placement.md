# Phase 10D - Police Checkpoints Placement

## Overview
Implement police checkpoint placement system along road network with strategic positioning for speed enforcement, avoiding gas station conflicts, and balanced gameplay challenge.

## Tasks

### Police Checkpoint Placement Algorithm
- Strategic placement along major routes for speed enforcement
- Distance-based spacing to ensure fair but challenging enforcement
- Avoid overlap with gas stations for clear road management
- Random distribution with balanced coverage across road network

### Speed Enforcement Strategy
- Placement at locations where speeding is likely to occur
- Highway segments with higher speed limits prioritized
- Approaches to cities where speed limits may change
- Long straight road segments where drivers may exceed limits

### Checkpoint Data Management
- Police checkpoint data structure with location and enforcement properties
- Speed limit and fine amount information
- Checkpoint operational status and detection capabilities
- Integration with save system for persistent placement

### Placement Validation System
- Ensure adequate enforcement coverage without over-policing
- Prevent clustering of checkpoints in single areas
- Maintain minimum distances from gas stations
- Validate accessibility and effectiveness from main road network

### Fine Structure System
- Predefined fine amounts based on speed violation severity
- Base fine amounts with escalation for repeat offenders
- Speed threshold tolerance before fines are issued
- Integration with credit system for fine processing

### Visual Representation
- Police checkpoint markers on map with enforcement indicators
- Conditional visibility based on vehicle selection and movement
- Warning indicators for approaching vehicles
- Professional law enforcement iconography

### Save System Integration
- Persistent checkpoint placement across game sessions
- Fine history tracking for enforcement effectiveness
- Checkpoint encounter statistics and player behavior
- Placement seed storage for consistent generation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Placement Quality
- ✅ Police checkpoints provide effective speed enforcement coverage
- ✅ Checkpoint spacing creates challenging but fair enforcement
- ✅ No conflicts with gas station placement
- ✅ Balanced distribution across major routes

### Enforcement System
- ✅ Checkpoints detect speeding vehicles accurately
- ✅ Fine calculations are fair and proportional
- ✅ Speed tolerance provides reasonable enforcement threshold
- ✅ Enforcement integrates properly with credit system

### System Integration
- ✅ Checkpoints integrate properly with map display system
- ✅ Conditional visibility works with vehicle selection
- ✅ Save system maintains checkpoint data correctly
- ✅ Speed detection integrates with vehicle speed system

### Gameplay Balance
- ✅ Checkpoint placement enhances strategic route planning
- ✅ Enforcement creates meaningful consequences for speeding
- ✅ Fine amounts are challenging but not game-breaking
- ✅ Warning systems provide fair notice to players

### Police Checkpoint Data Structure
```
PoliceCheckpointData:
- CheckpointId: Unique checkpoint identifier
- Position: World coordinates on road network
- RoadSegment: Associated road segment
- SpeedLimit: Enforced speed limit at checkpoint
- DetectionRadius: Area where speeding is detected
- BaseFineAmount: Standard fine for speed violations
- OperationalStatus: Checkpoint active/inactive state
```

### Placement Algorithm
1. Analyze road network for high-speed segments
2. Identify strategic enforcement locations
3. Calculate optimal spacing intervals for coverage
4. Generate candidate positions avoiding conflicts
5. Validate placement effectiveness and fairness
6. Assign enforcement parameters and fine amounts
7. Ensure balanced distribution across network
8. Store placement data for persistent sessions

### Fine Calculation System
```
FineCalculation:
- BaseSpeedLimit: Road segment speed limit
- VehicleSpeed: Actual vehicle speed detected
- SpeedViolation: VehicleSpeed - BaseSpeedLimit
- ToleranceThreshold: 5 km/h grace period
- BaseFine: Predefined base fine amount
- SeverityMultiplier: Based on violation amount
- FinalFine = BaseFine * (1 + SeverityMultiplier)
```

### Enforcement Zone Configuration
```
EnforcementZones:
- DetectionRadius: 100 units from checkpoint
- SpeedMeasurement: Average over 50 unit distance
- WarningDistance: 200 units before checkpoint
- ToleranceThreshold: 5 km/h over speed limit
- MaximumFine: 10% of current credits (cap)
```

## Dependencies
- Requires Phase 8B (Connected Road Network) for placement positions
- Requires Phase 8D (Conditional Map Details) for visibility system
- Requires Phase 1D (Save System) for persistent placement

## Integration Points
- Road network provides valid placement positions and speed limits
- Map detail system controls checkpoint visibility
- Vehicle speed system provides speed data for enforcement
- Save system stores checkpoint placement and fine history

## Notes

### Strategic Placement Guidelines
- Major highways: Regular checkpoints for speed enforcement
- City approaches: Checkpoints before speed limit reductions
- Long straight roads: Prevention of excessive speeding
- Route bottlenecks: Natural enforcement locations

### Placement Distance Guidelines
- Minimum 1500 units between consecutive checkpoints
- Maximum 5000 units without checkpoint on major routes
- Average spacing of 3000 units for balanced enforcement
- Strategic placement at speed limit change zones

### Gas Station Conflict Avoidance
- Minimum 300 units separation from gas stations
- Alternating placement to prevent consecutive stops
- Different visual markers for clear distinction
- Separate detection zones to prevent confusion

### Fine Structure Strategy
- Base fine: 5% of current credits (minimum 100, maximum 1000)
- Severity escalation: +25% per 10 km/h over limit
- Repeat offender penalty: +50% for multiple violations
- Maximum fine cap: 10% of total credits to prevent bankruptcy

### Speed Detection Logic
- Continuous speed monitoring within detection radius
- Average speed calculation over measurement distance
- Tolerance threshold before violation recorded
- Warning system for vehicles approaching checkpoints

### Enforcement Effectiveness
- Track violation rates and fine collection
- Adjust placement based on effectiveness data
- Balance enforcement with gameplay enjoyment
- Provide strategic route planning challenges

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient proximity detection for multiple vehicles
- Optimized collision detection for checkpoint zones
- Minimal memory usage for checkpoint data storage
- Fast lookup systems for checkpoint proximity queries

### Testing Requirements
- Test placement algorithm with various road network configurations
- Verify checkpoint spacing and coverage effectiveness
- Test conflict avoidance with gas station placement
- Validate save/load integration for checkpoint persistence
- Performance test with multiple vehicles and checkpoints active
