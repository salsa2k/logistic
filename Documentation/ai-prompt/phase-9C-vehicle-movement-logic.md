- Route deviation handling and correction

### Physics and Timing
- Realistic movement timing based on vehicle specifications
- Distance-based movement calculation for accuracy
- Time-based updates for smooth visual movement
- Integration with game time system for consistent timing

### Movement Interruption Handling
- Pause and resume movement functionality
- Save/load during active movement
- Emergency stop capabilities for critical situations
- Movement state recovery after interruptions

### Movement State Machine
```
MovementStates:
- Stationary: Vehicle not moving, available for assignment
- Preparing: Loading cargo, preparing for departure
- Accelerating: Building up to travel speed
- Moving: Traveling at steady speed
- Decelerating: Slowing down for arrival or stops
- Arriving: Final approach to destination
- Stopped: Temporarily halted (fuel, emergency)
```

### Movement Data Structure
```
MovementData:
- CurrentPosition: Vehicle's current world coordinates
- TargetPosition: Next waypoint or destination
- CurrentSpeed: Current velocity in km/h
- TargetSpeed: Desired speed for current conditions
- RouteProgress: Percentage of route completed
- MovementState: Current state in movement FSM
- LastUpdateTime: Timestamp of last movement update
```

### Speed Control Algorithm
```
SpeedControl:
- MaxSpeed: Vehicle specification maximum
- RoadSpeedLimit: Current road segment limit
- EffectiveSpeed: Min(MaxSpeed, RoadSpeedLimit)
- AccelerationRate: Realistic acceleration curve
- DecelerationRate: Braking capability
- SpeedAdjustment: Dynamic factors (weather, cargo)
```

### Route Following System
- Waypoint-to-waypoint navigation
- Look-ahead system for smooth curves
- Dynamic waypoint generation for complex routes
- Route deviation detection and correction

## Dependencies
- Requires Phase 9B (Network Pathfinding) for route data
- Requires Phase 8C (Vehicle Positioning) for position management
- Requires Phase 1D (Save System) for movement persistence

## Integration Points
- Pathfinding provides routes for movement execution
- Vehicle positioning updates based on movement calculations
- Fuel consumption system triggered by movement operations
- Contract system notified of movement progress and arrivals

## Notes

### Movement Timing Calculations
- Real-time movement based on actual elapsed time
- Distance calculations using vehicle specifications
- Speed adjustments for road conditions and traffic
- Accurate ETA calculations for delivery planning

### Route Following Implementation
1. Load calculated route from pathfinding system
2. Break route into manageable waypoint segments
3. Navigate from waypoint to waypoint with smooth interpolation
4. Monitor progress and update position continuously
5. Detect arrival at final destination
6. Update vehicle and contract status upon completion

### Speed Management Rules
- Never exceed vehicle maximum speed capability
- Always respect road speed limits
- Adjust speed for road conditions (weather, traffic)
- Apply cargo weight effects on acceleration/deceleration
- Emergency speed reduction for hazards or low fuel

### Movement Persistence Strategy
- Save current position, route, and movement state
- Store movement timing and progress information
- Handle time elapsed during save/load cycles
- Validate movement state consistency on load

### Performance Optimization
- Update moving vehicles more frequently than stationary ones
- Use level-of-detail for off-screen vehicle movement
- Batch movement calculations for efficiency
- Optimize pathfinding queries for active routes

### Arrival Detection Logic
- Define city arrival zones for destination detection
- Handle multiple vehicles arriving at same city
- Trigger appropriate events for contract completion
- Update vehicle status and location upon arrival

### Error Handling
- Route validation before starting movement
- Fallback routes for blocked or invalid paths
- Recovery procedures for movement system failures
- Graceful handling of data corruption or inconsistencies

### Testing Requirements
- Test movement accuracy with various route types
- Verify save/load integration during active movement
- Test performance with multiple simultaneous moving vehicles
- Validate arrival detection and contract completion
- Test error recovery and fallback scenarios
