# Phase 1B - Localization System

## Overview
Implement Unity's Localization package to support English and Brazilian Portuguese languages throughout the game.

## Tasks

### Localization Package Setup
- Install Unity Localization package
- Configure localization settings for the project
- Set up English as default language
- Add Brazilian Portuguese as secondary language

### Localization Tables Creation
- Create String Tables for all UI text elements
- Set up Asset Tables for localized assets (if needed)
- Organize tables by feature/system (MainMenu, Game, Settings, etc.)
- Implement fallback mechanisms for missing translations

### Integration with UI Systems
- Configure UI Toolkit elements to use localization
- Set up dynamic text binding for UI elements
- Implement language switching functionality
- Create localization key naming conventions

### Text Content Preparation
- Define all text keys for the game systems
- Prepare English translations for all content
- Set up Brazilian Portuguese translation structure
- Implement placeholder text system for development

### Settings Integration
- Create language selection dropdown in settings
- Implement immediate language switching
- Persist language preference in game settings
- Configure restart requirements if needed

## Acceptance Criteria

### Package Configuration
- ✅ Unity Localization package installed and configured
- ✅ English and Brazilian Portuguese locales set up
- ✅ Default language properly configured
- ✅ Localization settings accessible in project

### Translation Tables
- ✅ String tables created for all major game systems
- ✅ Organized table structure by feature area
- ✅ Fallback system implemented for missing keys
- ✅ Editor workflow for adding new translations established

### UI Integration
- ✅ UI Toolkit elements properly connected to localization
- ✅ Dynamic text updates when language changes
- ✅ All UI text uses localization keys instead of hardcoded strings
- ✅ Image/asset localization support if needed

### Language Switching
- ✅ Settings dropdown allows language selection
- ✅ Language changes apply immediately throughout game
- ✅ Language preference persisted in settings
- ✅ No broken UI when switching languages

## Technical Notes

### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive keys: "MainMenu_NewGame_Button", "Settings_Language_Label"
- Group keys by system/feature for organization
- Use consistent naming patterns across all tables
- Document key usage for team reference

### Performance Considerations
- Load only active language tables
- Consider memory usage for large translation sets
- Implement efficient string lookup mechanisms
- Cache frequently used translations

### Integration Points
- All UI components must support localization
- Settings system will control language selection
- Save system should persist language preferences
- Error messages and notifications need localization

### Development Workflow
- Use English keys as development placeholders
- Implement translation review process
- Set up tools for translator collaboration
- Create validation for missing translations

## Dependencies
- Requires Phase 1A (Basic Unity Setup) for project structure
- Will be used by all UI phases for text display

## Integration Points
- Settings system will use this for language selection
- All UI components will integrate with localization
- Save/load system will persist language preferences
- Asset Manager will provide access to localized assets

## Notes
- Brazilian Portuguese requires specific formatting considerations
- Test UI layout with longer Portuguese text
- Consider cultural differences in UI design
- Plan for future language additions
- Ensure all game text is translatable (no hardcoded strings)
