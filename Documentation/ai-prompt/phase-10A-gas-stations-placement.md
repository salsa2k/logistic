# Phase 10A - Gas Stations Placement

## Overview
Implement gas station placement system along road network with three different brands, varied pricing, and strategic positioning for gameplay balance with save system integration.

## Tasks

### Gas Station Placement Algorithm
- Strategic placement along major routes between cities
- Distance-based spacing (every 1000-2000 units as specified)
- Avoid overlap with police checkpoints for clear road management
- Random distribution with balanced coverage across road network

### Gas Station Brand System
- Three distinct gas station brands with different characteristics
- Brand-specific pricing structures and service levels
- Visual differentiation between brands on map display
- Brand preference tracking for player choice analysis

### Pricing Strategy Implementation
- Different price per liter for each gas station brand
- Dynamic pricing based on location and demand
- Regional price variations for strategic gameplay
- Price display and comparison systems

### Placement Validation System
- Ensure adequate coverage for all major routes
- Prevent clustering of stations in single areas
- Maintain minimum distances from police checkpoints
- Validate accessibility from main road network

### Station Data Management
- Gas station data structure with location and properties
- Brand information, pricing, and service capabilities
- Station availability and operational status
- Integration with save system for persistent placement

### Visual Representation
- Gas station markers on map with brand identification
- Conditional visibility based on vehicle selection
- Distance and pricing information display
- Professional gas station iconography

### Save System Integration
- Persistent gas station placement across game sessions
- Price history tracking for economic gameplay
- Station usage statistics and player preferences
- Placement seed storage for consistent generation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Placement Quality
- ✅ Gas stations provide adequate coverage of all major routes
- ✅ Station spacing follows specified distance guidelines
- ✅ No conflicts with police checkpoint placement
- ✅ Balanced distribution across the entire road network

### Brand Differentiation
- ✅ Three gas station brands are clearly distinguishable
- ✅ Pricing differences create meaningful choices
- ✅ Brand characteristics affect gameplay decisions
- ✅ Visual representation clearly shows brand identity

### System Integration
- ✅ Gas stations integrate properly with map display system
- ✅ Conditional visibility works with vehicle selection
- ✅ Save system maintains station data correctly
- ✅ Pricing system integrates with credit management

### Gameplay Balance
- ✅ Station placement enhances strategic route planning
- ✅ Fuel availability doesn't trivialize fuel management
- ✅ Price variations create interesting economic decisions
- ✅ Emergency refuel options remain challenging but fair

├── StationPlacer.cs (placement algorithm)
├── StationBrandManager.cs (brand system)
├── StationPricing.cs (pricing management)
├── PlacementValidator.cs (placement verification)
└── StationRenderer.cs (visual representation)
```

### Gas Station Data Structure
```
GasStationData:
- StationId: Unique station identifier
- Position: World coordinates on road network
- Brand: Brand identifier (0-2 for three brands)
- BasePrice: Price per liter in credits
- RoadSegment: Associated road segment
- DistanceFromCity: Distance to nearest city
- ServiceLevel: Quality rating (affects price)
```

### Brand Characteristics
```
GasStationBrands:
- Brand A "QuickFuel": Low prices, basic service
- Brand B "RoadMaster": Medium prices, standard service  
- Brand C "Premium Plus": High prices, premium service
- PriceDifference: ~15% between adjacent brands
- ServiceBenefits: Faster refuel, loyalty discounts
```

### Placement Algorithm
1. Analyze road network for major routes
2. Calculate optimal spacing intervals (1000-2000 units)
3. Generate candidate positions along routes
4. Filter candidates to avoid checkpoint conflicts
5. Select positions ensuring balanced coverage
6. Assign brands randomly with distribution balance
7. Set pricing based on brand and location factors
8. Validate final placement meets all requirements

### Pricing Strategy
```
PricingFactors:
- BaseBrandPrice: Brand-specific base cost
- LocationModifier: Remote locations 10-20% higher
- DemandFactor: High-traffic routes slightly higher
- CompetitionFactor: Multiple nearby stations reduce prices
- FinalPrice = BaseBrandPrice * LocationModifier * DemandFactor
```

## Dependencies
- Requires Phase 8B (Connected Road Network) for placement positions
- Requires Phase 8D (Conditional Map Details) for visibility system
- Requires Phase 1D (Save System) for persistent placement

## Integration Points
- Road network provides valid placement positions
- Map detail system controls station visibility
- Vehicle fuel system uses stations for refueling
- Save system stores station placement and pricing data

## Notes

### Placement Strategy
- Major highways: Higher station density for long routes
- City approaches: Stations before entering urban areas
- Remote areas: Sparse but strategic placement
- Route intersections: Prime locations for multiple coverage

### Brand Distribution Guidelines
- Roughly equal distribution of three brands
- No more than two consecutive stations of same brand
- Premium brand concentrated on major routes
- Budget brand more common in remote areas

### Distance Guidelines
- Minimum 800 units between any two stations
- Maximum 2500 units without station on major routes
- Average spacing of 1500 units for balanced gameplay
- Emergency coverage ensuring no impossible gaps

### Checkpoint Conflict Avoidance
- Minimum 200 units separation from police checkpoints
- Stagger placement to prevent visual confusion
- Different icons and colors for clear distinction
- Separate interaction zones to prevent conflicts

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient placement algorithm for large road networks
- Optimized collision detection for placement validation
- Minimal memory usage for station data storage
- Fast lookup systems for station proximity queries

### Accessibility Features
- Clear visual distinction between gas station brands
- High contrast markers for visibility issues
- Screen reader support for station information
- Keyboard navigation for station selection

### Testing Requirements
- Test placement algorithm with various road network configurations
- Verify brand distribution and pricing balance
- Test conflict avoidance with checkpoint placement
- Validate save/load integration for station persistence
- Performance test with large numbers of gas stations
