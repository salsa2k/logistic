# Phase 5G - Settings Persistence

## Overview
Implement comprehensive settings persistence system that saves all player preferences to disk and maintains settings across game sessions with the save/load system integration.

## Tasks

### Settings Persistence Architecture
- Design SettingsPersistence manager for centralized settings storage
- Create settings file structure with versioning support
- Implement settings serialization and deserialization
- Set up automatic settings backup and recovery mechanisms

### Settings Data Management
- Unified settings data structure for all game preferences
- Settings validation and default value management
- Settings migration for version compatibility
- Conflict resolution between different settings sources

### File System Integration
- Settings file location and naming conventions
- Platform-specific settings storage paths
- File access permissions and error handling
- Settings file corruption detection and recovery

### Save System Integration
- Integration with main game save system
- Settings inclusion in complete game saves
- Separate settings files for standalone preference storage
- Coordinated save/load operations for settings and game data

### Settings Synchronization
- Synchronization between main menu and in-game settings
- Real-time settings updates across all game systems
- Settings change event propagation
- Consistency maintenance during concurrent access

### Automatic Settings Management
- Auto-save functionality for settings changes
- Periodic settings backup creation
- Settings restoration on game startup
- Default settings application for new installations

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient settings file I/O operations
- Cached settings for frequent access
- Batch settings updates to reduce disk operations
- Asynchronous settings saving to prevent blocking

## Acceptance Criteria

### Data Integrity
- ✅ Settings persist correctly across game sessions
- ✅ Settings data maintains integrity through save/load cycles
- ✅ Corruption detection and recovery work reliably
- ✅ Version migration preserves user preferences

### Performance
- ✅ Settings save/load operations don't impact gameplay
- ✅ Frequent settings access is efficiently cached
- ✅ Batch updates reduce unnecessary disk operations
- ✅ Async operations prevent UI blocking

### Reliability
- ✅ Settings recovery works when files are corrupted
- ✅ Default settings application works for new installs
- ✅ Error handling provides graceful degradation
- ✅ Backup and restore mechanisms function correctly

### Integration
- ✅ Seamless integration with main save system
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all settings interfaces
- ✅ Real-time synchronization between different settings sources
- ✅ Platform compatibility for settings storage

## Technical Notes

### Component Structure
```
SettingsPersistence/
├── SettingsPersistenceManager.cs (main persistence logic)
├── SettingsSerializer.cs (data serialization)
├── SettingsValidator.cs (data validation)
├── SettingsBackup.cs (backup management)
└── SettingsMigration.cs (version compatibility)
```

### Settings File Structure
```
Settings/
├── UserSettings.json (main settings file)
├── UserSettings.backup (automatic backup)
├── DefaultSettings.json (fallback defaults)
└── SettingsVersion.txt (version tracking)
```

### Settings Data Structure
```
SettingsData:
- Version: Settings file format version
- Language: Selected game language
- UnitSystem: Metric or Imperial units
- AudioSettings: Volume and sound preferences
- DisplaySettings: Resolution and visual options
- GameplaySettings: Game-specific preferences
- LastModified: Timestamp of last settings change
```

### Persistence Workflow
1. Settings change triggered by user action
2. Validation of new settings values
3. Update in-memory settings cache
4. Queue settings save operation
5. Asynchronous file write with backup creation
6. Notify all systems of settings changes
7. Confirm successful persistence

## Dependencies
- Requires Phase 1D (Save System) for integration
- Requires Phase 3B (Settings Modal) for main menu settings
- Requires Phase 5F (Game Settings Modal) for in-game settings

## Integration Points
- Save system coordinates with settings persistence
- All settings interfaces use this system for data storage
- Game systems subscribe to settings change events
- Platform-specific file system integration

## Notes

### File Format Considerations
- JSON format for human readability and debugging
- Binary format option for performance if needed
- Compression for large settings files
- Encryption for sensitive preferences

### Version Migration Strategy
- Semantic versioning for settings file format
- Backward compatibility for older settings files
- Migration scripts for breaking changes
- Safe fallback to defaults for unsupported versions

### Error Handling Scenarios
- **File Not Found**: Create new settings file with defaults
- **Corrupted Data**: Restore from backup or use defaults
- **Permission Denied**: Use temporary storage and notify user
- **Disk Full**: Cleanup old backups and retry operation

### Platform-Specific Storage
- **Windows**: %APPDATA%/CompanyName/GameName/
- **Mac**: ~/Library/Application Support/GameName/
- **Linux**: ~/.config/GameName/
- **Unity Persistent Data Path**: Application.persistentDataPath

### Performance Optimization
- Settings cache in memory for fast access
- Dirty flag tracking for changed settings
- Batched save operations with debouncing
- Background thread for file I/O operations

### Security Considerations
- Validate all settings values before persistence
- Prevent path traversal attacks in file operations
- Sanitize user input for settings values
- Protect against settings file manipulation

### Testing Requirements
- Test settings persistence across game restarts
- Verify corruption detection and recovery
- Test version migration with various scenarios
- Validate performance with frequent settings changes
- Test platform-specific storage behavior
