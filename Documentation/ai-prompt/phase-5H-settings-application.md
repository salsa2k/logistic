# Phase 5H - Settings Application

## Overview
Implement comprehensive settings application system that applies user preferences throughout all game systems with real-time updates and consistent behavior.

## Tasks

### Settings Application Architecture
- Design SettingsApplicator for centralized settings application
- Create settings change event system for real-time updates
- Implement settings validation and conflict resolution
- Set up immediate and deferred application strategies

### Language Settings Application
- Immediate language switching throughout all game interfaces
- Localization system integration for text updates
- UI layout adjustments for different languages
- Asset loading for language-specific content

### Unit System Application
- Real-time conversion of all displayed measurements
- Distance, weight, volume, and speed unit conversions
- Consistent unit labeling throughout the interface
- Calculation system integration for metric/imperial handling

### Audio Settings Application
- Master volume control for all game audio
- Individual volume controls for music, SFX, and UI sounds
- Audio system integration with immediate effect
- Audio preference persistence and restoration

### Display Settings Application
- Resolution changes with safe mode fallback
- Fullscreen/windowed mode switching
- UI scaling for different screen sizes and DPI
- Graphics quality adjustments and performance optimization

### Gameplay Settings Application
- Tutorial system enable/disable functionality
- Auto-save frequency and behavior settings
- Difficulty and game balance adjustments
- Accessibility feature toggles and applications

### Real-time Update System
- Event-driven settings propagation to all game systems
- Immediate visual feedback for settings changes
- System coordination for settings that affect multiple components
- Rollback mechanisms for problematic settings

### Settings Validation and Safety
- Settings value validation before application
- Safe mode detection for problematic display settings
- Automatic revert mechanisms for invalid configurations
- User confirmation for potentially disruptive changes

## Acceptance Criteria

### Immediate Application
- ✅ Language changes update all visible text immediately
- ✅ Unit conversions apply to all displayed values in real-time
- ✅ Audio changes provide immediate volume feedback
- ✅ Display changes apply without requiring game restart

### System Coordination
- ✅ All game systems respond correctly to settings changes
- ✅ Settings conflicts are resolved consistently
- ✅ Event propagation reaches all interested systems
- ✅ UI updates reflect settings changes immediately

### User Experience
- ✅ Settings changes feel immediate and responsive
- ✅ Visual feedback confirms successful application
- ✅ Error handling provides clear guidance for problems
- ✅ Rollback mechanisms work when needed

### Performance
- ✅ Settings application doesn't cause frame drops
- ✅ Real-time updates are efficient and optimized
- ✅ Memory usage remains stable during settings changes
- ✅ No performance degradation from frequent updates

## Technical Notes

### Component Structure
```
SettingsApplication/
├── SettingsApplicator.cs (main application logic)
├── LanguageApplicator.cs (localization handling)
├── UnitSystemApplicator.cs (measurement conversions)
├── AudioApplicator.cs (sound system integration)
├── DisplayApplicator.cs (graphics and display)
└── SettingsValidator.cs (validation and safety)
```

### Settings Event System
```
SettingsEvents:
- OnLanguageChanged (string newLanguage)
- OnUnitSystemChanged (UnitSystem newSystem)
- OnAudioSettingsChanged (AudioSettings settings)
- OnDisplaySettingsChanged (DisplaySettings settings)
- OnGameplaySettingsChanged (GameplaySettings settings)
```

### Application Strategies
- **Immediate**: Language, audio, UI preferences
- **Deferred**: Display resolution, graphics quality
- **Validated**: All settings with potential for problems
- **Batched**: Multiple related settings applied together

### Unit Conversion System
```
UnitConversions:
- Distance: km ↔ miles
- Weight: kg ↔ pounds
- Volume: liters ↔ gallons
- Speed: km/h ↔ mph
- Temperature: Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit (if needed)
```

## Dependencies
- Requires Phase 5G (Settings Persistence) for settings data
- Requires Phase 1B (Localization System) for language switching
- Integrates with all game systems that display or use settings

## Integration Points
- Localization system handles language changes
- Audio system responds to volume settings
- UI systems update with display and language changes
- All measurement displays use unit conversion system

## Notes

### Language Application Process
1. New language setting received
2. Localization system loads new language data
3. All UI elements refresh with new text
4. Layout adjustments made for text length differences
5. Language-specific assets loaded if needed

### Unit System Application Process
1. Unit system change triggered
2. All displayed measurements converted
3. Unit labels updated throughout interface
4. Internal calculations remain in metric
5. Display formatters use selected unit system

### Audio Application Process
1. Audio settings change received
2. Audio system mixer updated immediately
3. Volume levels applied to all audio sources
4. Audio test feedback provided to user
5. Settings persisted for next session

### Display Settings Safety
- Safe mode detection for resolution changes
- Automatic revert after timeout without confirmation
- Fallback to last known good settings
- User confirmation required for risky changes

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient event propagation to minimize overhead
- Cached conversion factors for unit system
- Optimized UI updates to prevent unnecessary redraws
- Background processing for heavy settings changes

### Error Handling
- **Invalid Values**: Fallback to nearest valid setting
- **System Conflicts**: Priority-based resolution
- **Application Failure**: Rollback to previous settings
- **Resource Loading**: Graceful degradation with defaults

### Testing Requirements
- Test all settings combinations and interactions
- Verify immediate application without game disruption
- Test rollback mechanisms with problematic settings
- Validate performance during frequent settings changes
- Test cross-system coordination and event propagation
