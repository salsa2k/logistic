# Phase 4A - Game Scene Layout

## Overview
Create the main game scene layout using dark graphite theme with top menu bar, map area, and responsive design for the core gameplay interface.

## Tasks

### Game Scene Architecture
- Design main game scene layout with clear area divisions
- Create responsive layout system for different screen sizes
- Implement dark graphite theme throughout the interface
- Set up scene management and navigation systems

### Layout Areas Definition
- Top menu bar spanning full width of screen
- Main map area taking majority of screen space
- Side panels for detailed information (collapsible)
- Bottom status bar for quick information display
- Modal overlay area for popups and dialogs

### Responsive Design System
- Minimum resolution support (1280x720)
- Scalable layout for larger resolutions
- Adaptive UI element sizing
- Proper aspect ratio maintenance

### Scene Navigation
- Smooth transitions between different game views
- State management for current active view
- Breadcrumb navigation for complex interfaces
- Back button functionality where appropriate

### Integration Framework
- Window and modal management system
- Event routing for user interactions
- Data binding for dynamic content updates
- Asset loading and management coordination

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient UI element management
- Memory optimization for long gameplay sessions
- Frame rate maintenance during UI updates
- Background loading for complex interfaces

## Acceptance Criteria

### Layout Structure
- ✅ Game scene uses dark graphite theme consistently
- ✅ All layout areas are properly defined and positioned
- ✅ Responsive design works at minimum resolution
- ✅ Layout scales appropriately for larger screens

### Navigation
- ✅ Scene transitions are smooth and responsive
- ✅ Navigation state is maintained correctly
- ✅ Back functionality works where appropriate
- ✅ Menu integration works seamlessly

### Performance
- ✅ UI rendering is efficient and smooth
- ✅ Memory usage is optimized for long sessions
- ✅ Frame rate remains stable during UI operations
- ✅ Asset loading doesn't block user interactions

### Integration
- ✅ Window and modal systems work correctly
- ✅ Event system handles user interactions properly
- ✅ Data binding updates content dynamically
- ✅ Save/load integration maintains scene state

## Technical Notes

### Scene Structure
```
GameScene/
├── GameSceneController.cs (main scene controller)
├── GameSceneDocument.uxml (scene layout)
├── GameSceneStyles.uss (scene styling)
├── LayoutManager.cs (responsive layout)
└── NavigationManager.cs (scene navigation)
```

### Layout Areas
- **Top Menu Bar**: 60px height, full width
- **Main Content**: Remaining vertical space
- **Side Panels**: 300px width when expanded
- **Bottom Status**: 40px height when visible
- **Modal Overlay**: Full screen z-index management

### USS Class Naming
- .game-scene (root container)
- .top-menu-area (menu bar region)
- .main-content-area (primary content)
- .side-panel (collapsible panels)
- .bottom-status-area (status information)
- .modal-overlay-area (popup management)

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Small**: 1280x720 (minimum)
- **Medium**: 1920x1080 (standard)
- **Large**: 2560x1440+ (high resolution)
- **Ultrawide**: 21:9 aspect ratios

## Dependencies
- Requires Phase 2B (Base Window Component) for interface foundation
- Requires Phase 2A (Dark Graphite Theme) for styling
- Will host all subsequent game interface components

## Integration Points
- Scene Manager handles transitions to/from game scene
- Window Manager coordinates multiple interface windows
- Asset Manager provides scene assets and resources
- Save/Load system maintains scene state and preferences

## Notes

### Design Principles
- **Clarity**: Clear visual hierarchy and information organization
- **Efficiency**: Quick access to frequently used functions
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable to different gameplay needs
- **Consistency**: Uniform appearance and behavior patterns

### Layout Flexibility
- Collapsible side panels for more map space
- Resizable interface elements where appropriate
- Customizable layout preferences for users
- Context-sensitive interface element visibility

### Performance Considerations
- Use UI Toolkit's efficient rendering system
- Implement virtual scrolling for large data lists
- Optimize texture usage for UI elements
- Consider memory pooling for frequently created/destroyed elements

### Accessibility Features
- Keyboard navigation throughout all interface areas
- Screen reader support for all interactive elements
- High contrast mode compatibility
- Focus management and visual indicators

### Testing Requirements
- Test at all supported resolutions and aspect ratios
- Verify responsive behavior during window resizing
- Performance test with complex interface configurations
- Validate accessibility compliance across all features
- Test scene transitions and state management
