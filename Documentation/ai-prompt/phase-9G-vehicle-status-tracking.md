# Phase 9G - Vehicle Status Tracking

## Overview
Implement comprehensive vehicle status tracking system that monitors and manages all vehicle states, transitions, and conditions with save system integration and UI coordination.

## Tasks

### Vehicle Status Management
- Centralized tracking of all vehicle operational states
- Status transition validation and management
- Status history logging for performance analysis
- Real-time status updates across all game systems

### Status Categories and States
- Operational status: Available, assigned, moving, arrived, maintenance
- Fuel status: Normal, low, critical, empty, refueling
- Cargo status: Empty, loading, loaded, unloading
- Emergency status: Normal, warning, emergency, stranded
- Contract status: No contract, assigned, in progress, ready to complete

### Status Transition Logic
- Valid status transition rules and validation
- Automatic status changes based on game events
- Manual status overrides for special situations
- Status conflict resolution and priority management

### Status Event System
- Event notifications for status changes
- UI update triggers for status modifications
- System integration events for status-dependent operations
- Historical event logging for analysis and debugging

### Visual Status Indicators
- Status-based visual representation across all interfaces
- Color-coded status indicators with consistent theming
- Animation effects for status transitions
- Priority-based status display for multiple concurrent states

### Status-Based Functionality
- Available operations based on current vehicle status
- Status-dependent UI element enabling/disabling
- Conditional feature access based on status
- Status-driven automation and decision making

### Save System Integration
- Persistent storage of vehicle status across sessions
- Status history preservation for analysis
- Status restoration with validation on game load
- Status migration for save file version compatibility

## Acceptance Criteria

### Status Accuracy
- ✅ Vehicle status accurately reflects actual vehicle conditions
- ✅ Status transitions follow logical rules and validation
- ✅ Multiple status dimensions work together correctly
- ✅ Status persistence maintains accuracy across sessions

### System Integration
- ✅ Status changes propagate correctly to all interested systems
- ✅ UI components reflect status changes immediately
- ✅ Status-dependent operations work reliably
- ✅ Save system maintains status integrity

### User Experience
- ✅ Status indicators are clear and intuitive
- ✅ Status information is easily accessible
- ✅ Status transitions provide appropriate feedback
- ✅ Status-based restrictions are clearly communicated

### Performance
- ✅ Status tracking maintains smooth game performance
- ✅ Real-time updates don't cause frame drops
- ✅ Large vehicle fleets don't impact status system performance
- ✅ Memory usage is optimized for status operations

## Technical Notes

### Component Structure
```
VehicleStatusTracking/
├── VehicleStatusManager.cs (central status management)
├── StatusTracker.cs (individual vehicle status tracking)
├── StatusTransitionValidator.cs (transition rule enforcement)
├── StatusEventHandler.cs (event processing and notifications)
└── StatusPersistence.cs (save system integration)
```

### Vehicle Status Structure
```
VehicleStatus:
- VehicleId: Unique vehicle identifier
- OperationalStatus: Primary operational state
- FuelStatus: Fuel-related status
- CargoStatus: Cargo-related status
- EmergencyStatus: Emergency condition status
- ContractStatus: Contract-related status
- LastStatusChange: Timestamp of last status update
- StatusHistory: Recent status change log
```

### Status Enumeration
```
StatusTypes:
- OperationalStatus: Available, Assigned, Moving, Arrived, Maintenance, OutOfService
- FuelStatus: Normal, Low, Critical, Empty, Refueling, EmergencyRefuel
- CargoStatus: Empty, Loading, Loaded, Unloading, Damaged
- EmergencyStatus: Normal, Warning, Emergency, Stranded, Breakdown
- ContractStatus: NoContract, Assigned, InProgress, ReadyToComplete, Completed
```

### Status Transition Rules
```
TransitionRules:
- Available → Assigned: When contract accepted
- Assigned → Moving: When vehicle starts journey
- Moving → Arrived: When destination reached
- Normal → Low: When fuel drops below 25%
- Low → Critical: When fuel drops below 10%
- Critical → Empty: When fuel reaches 0%
```

### Status Priority System
- Emergency status takes precedence over all others
- Fuel status overrides operational status for display
- Contract status provides context for operations
- Cargo status affects available actions

## Dependencies
- Requires Phase 9F (Real-Time Vehicle Updates) for status triggers
- Requires Phase 9D (Fuel Consumption System) for fuel status
- Requires Phase 1D (Save System) for status persistence

## Integration Points
- Real-time update system triggers status changes
- Fuel consumption system updates fuel status
- Contract system updates contract status
- UI systems display status information

## Notes

### Status Change Workflow
1. Monitor vehicle conditions and game events
2. Detect conditions requiring status changes
3. Validate proposed status transitions
4. Apply status changes with event notifications
5. Update UI components with new status
6. Log status change in history
7. Trigger dependent system updates
8. Save status changes for persistence

### Status Display Priority
- **Emergency**: Red indicators, highest priority
- **Critical Fuel**: Orange warnings, high priority
- **Low Fuel**: Yellow warnings, medium priority
- **Operational**: Green/blue normal status, low priority
- **Contract**: Information status, context only

### Status-Based Operations
- **Available**: Can accept contracts, move to new cities
- **Assigned**: Can start journey, cancel contract
- **Moving**: Can show route, emergency stop
- **Arrived**: Can complete contract, unload cargo
- **Emergency**: Limited to emergency operations only

### Status Event Categories
- **Immediate**: Critical events requiring instant response
- **Important**: Events that affect operations significantly
- **Informational**: Status updates for tracking purposes
- **Historical**: Events logged for analysis only

### Status Validation Rules
- No conflicting status combinations allowed
- Status changes must follow logical progression
- Emergency status can override normal progression
- Invalid status automatically corrected with logging

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient status change detection algorithms
- Batch status updates for multiple vehicles
- Cached status queries for frequent access
- Optimized event notification systems

### Error Handling
- Invalid status combinations automatically corrected
- Missing status information filled with defaults
- Status corruption detection and recovery
- Graceful degradation for status system failures

### Testing Requirements
- Test all status transition combinations
- Verify status persistence through save/load cycles
- Test status-based operation restrictions
- Validate status display accuracy across interfaces
- Performance test with large numbers of vehicles and status changes
