# Phase 1E - Load System

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive load system that restores complete game state from save files, handles version compatibility, and provides error recovery.

## Tasks

### Load System Architecture
- Create LoadManager that works with SaveManager
- Implement save file discovery and validation
- Design load operation with progress tracking
- Set up error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Game State Restoration
- Load and restore complete game state from save files
- Reconstruct all vehicle instances with correct states
- Restore contract progress and availability
- Reload company data and player progress
- Restore settings and preferences

### Save File Validation
- Verify save file integrity before loading
- Check save file version compatibility
- Validate data consistency and relationships
- Handle corrupted or incomplete save files

### Loading UI and Feedback
- Display loading progress to players
- Show save file metadata (date, progress level, play time)
- Provide save file selection interface
- Handle loading errors with user-friendly messages

### Version Compatibility
- Support loading saves from previous game versions
- Implement data migration for outdated save formats
- Handle missing or new data fields gracefully
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible

### Performance Optimization
- Implement asynchronous loading operations
- Stream large datasets efficiently
- Optimize memory usage during load operations
- Provide incremental loading for large save files

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Load Functionality
- ✅ Complete game state loads accurately from save files
- ✅ All game systems restored to exact saved state
- ✅ Player can continue game seamlessly from saved point
- ✅ No data loss during load operations

### Error Handling
- ✅ Corrupted save files detected and handled gracefully
- ✅ Missing save files don't crash the game
- ✅ Version incompatibilities resolved automatically
- ✅ User receives clear feedback on load failures

### Performance Requirements
- ✅ Load operations complete within reasonable time
- ✅ No frame drops during loading process
- ✅ Memory usage optimized for load operations
- ✅ Loading progress shown to prevent user confusion

### User Experience
- ✅ Save file selection interface is intuitive
- ✅ Save metadata displayed clearly
- ✅ Loading feedback prevents perceived freezing
- ✅ Error messages are helpful and actionable

## Technical Notes

### Load Process Flow
1. Discover available save files
2. Validate selected save file
3. Check version compatibility
4. Load core game state
5. Restore all game systems
6. Verify data integrity
7. Initialize game with loaded state

### Error Recovery Strategies
- Fall back to last known good save
- Offer partial load with missing data warnings
- Provide save file repair options when possible
- Create emergency backup before load attempts

### Version Migration
```
Version 1.0 → 1.1: Add new vehicle properties
Version 1.1 → 1.2: Update contract data structure
Version 1.2 → 1.3: Add license system
```

### Performance Considerations
- Use coroutines for long load operations
- Load data in chunks to prevent frame drops
- Implement progress reporting for user feedback
- Cache frequently accessed loaded data

## Dependencies
- Requires Phase 1A (Basic Unity Setup) for GameManager
- Requires Phase 1C (Data Structures) for data types
- Requires Phase 1D (Save System) for save file format
- Will integrate with all game systems for state restoration

## Integration Points
- GameManager orchestrates load operations
- All game systems must support state restoration
- UI systems display load progress and file selection
- Settings system applies loaded preferences immediately

## Notes

### Data Validation During Load
- Verify all references are valid
- Check data ranges and constraints
- Ensure object relationships are correct
- Validate game state logic consistency

### Loading Strategies
- **Full Load**: Complete game state loaded at once
- **Lazy Load**: Load data as systems request it
- **Streaming Load**: Load large datasets progressively
- **Cached Load**: Keep frequently used data in memory

### Error Scenarios to Handle
- File not found or inaccessible
- Corrupted or incomplete data
- Version incompatibility
- Insufficient memory for load operation
- Platform-specific file system issues

### Testing Requirements
- Test with saves from all supported versions
- Verify load performance with large save files
- Test error recovery with corrupted files
- Validate complete game state restoration
- Test load operation cancellation

### Development Tools
- Save file inspector for debugging
- Load operation profiler
- Save file validator tool
- Version migration tester
- Performance benchmarking tools
