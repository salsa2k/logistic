# Phase 9F - Real-Time Vehicle Updates

## Overview
Implement real-time vehicle update system that continuously tracks and updates vehicle positions, status, fuel levels, and other dynamic properties with auto-save integration.

## Tasks

### Real-Time Update Architecture
- Continuous monitoring and updating of vehicle properties
- Efficient update cycles for different vehicle states
- Event-driven updates for state changes
- Auto-save integration for persistent vehicle state

### Position Update System
- Real-time position tracking for moving vehicles
- Smooth interpolation between update intervals
- Position synchronization across all UI components
- Efficient position updates without performance impact

### Status Update Management
- Vehicle operational status monitoring and updates
- State change detection and notification
- Status synchronization between game systems
- Real-time status indicators in UI components

### Fuel Level Monitoring
- Continuous fuel consumption tracking during movement
- Real-time fuel gauge updates
- Fuel warning triggers and notifications
- Emergency fuel detection and handling

### Progress Tracking
- Contract progress monitoring for assigned vehicles
- Route completion percentage calculation

## Technical Notes

### Component Structure
```
RealTimeUpdates/
├── VehicleUpdateManager.cs (central update coordination)
├── PositionUpdater.cs (position tracking and updates)
├── StatusUpdater.cs (status monitoring and changes)
├── ProgressTracker.cs (contract and route progress)
└── AutoSaveScheduler.cs (automatic save coordination)
```

### Update Frequency Strategy
```
UpdateFrequencies:
- SelectedVehicle: 10 updates per second (high frequency)
- MovingVehicles: 2 updates per second (medium frequency)
- AssignedVehicles: 1 update per second (low frequency)
- IdleVehicles: 0.2 updates per second (minimal frequency)
- OffScreenVehicles: Event-driven only (on-demand)
```

### Update Event System
```
UpdateEvents:
- OnPositionChanged(VehicleId, NewPosition)
- OnStatusChanged(VehicleId, OldStatus, NewStatus)
- OnFuelLevelChanged(VehicleId, NewFuelLevel)
- OnProgressUpdated(VehicleId, ContractId, Progress)
- OnVehicleArrived(VehicleId, DestinationCity)
```

### Auto-Save Triggers
```
AutoSaveTriggers:
- VehicleArrivedAtDestination: Immediate save
- FuelLevelCritical: Save fuel state
- ContractProgressMilestone: Save progress
- VehicleStatusChange: Save status updates
- PeriodicSave: Every 60 seconds for active vehicles
```

## Dependencies
- Requires Phase 9C (Vehicle Movement Logic) for movement data
- Requires Phase 9D (Fuel Consumption System) for fuel tracking
- Requires Phase 1D (Save System) for auto-save integration

## Integration Points
- Vehicle movement provides position and progress data
- Fuel system provides consumption and level updates
- Save system handles automatic persistence
- UI systems receive real-time update notifications

## Notes

### Update Scheduling Algorithm
1. Categorize vehicles by activity level and importance
2. Assign update frequency based on category
3. Schedule updates with time offset to distribute load
4. Process updates in batches for efficiency
5. Trigger immediate updates for critical events
6. Adjust frequencies based on performance metrics

### Position Update Process
- Calculate new position based on movement system
- Apply smooth interpolation for visual movement
- Update position in all relevant data structures
- Notify UI components of position changes
- Check for arrival at waypoints or destinations

### Status Update Categories
- **Movement Status**: Stationary, moving, arrived
- **Operational Status**: Available, assigned, maintenance
- **Fuel Status**: Normal, low, critical, empty
- **Contract Status**: No contract, active, ready to complete
- **Emergency Status**: Normal, warning, emergency

### Performance Optimization
- Update batching to reduce individual processing overhead
- Spatial culling for off-screen vehicles
- Level-of-detail updates based on distance from camera
- Cached calculations for frequently accessed data

### Auto-Save Strategy
- High-priority saves for critical state changes
- Low-priority saves for routine updates
- Save batching to reduce disk I/O frequency
- Intelligent save scheduling to avoid performance spikes

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of update failures
- Recovery procedures for corrupted vehicle state
- Fallback mechanisms for missing update data
- Validation of update consistency across systems

### Testing Requirements
- Test update accuracy with various vehicle scenarios
- Verify performance with large vehicle fleets
- Test auto-save integration and recovery
- Validate update synchronization across UI components
- Performance test update frequency optimization
