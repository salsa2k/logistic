# Phase 9A - Vehicle Selection

## Overview
Implement comprehensive vehicle selection system that coordinates between map view, vehicle list, and game interfaces while saving selected vehicle state.

## Tasks

### Vehicle Selection Management
- Centralized vehicle selection state management
- Selection coordination between map and list interfaces
- Vehicle focus and highlighting across all UI components
- Save system integration for persistent vehicle selection

### Map-Based Vehicle Selection
- Click/touch selection of vehicles on map
- Visual feedback for selected vehicle on map display
- Selected vehicle highlighting with distinctive markers
- Map camera focus and zoom-to-vehicle functionality

### List-Based Vehicle Selection
- Vehicle selection through vehicles list interface
- Synchronized selection state between map and list
- Selected vehicle emphasis in list display
- Scroll-to-selected functionality for large vehicle lists

### Multi-Interface Coordination
- Consistent selection state across all game interfaces
- Selection change notifications to all interested systems
- Active vehicle tracking for context-sensitive operations
- Selection persistence during interface navigation

### Selection Visual Feedback
- Distinctive highlighting for selected vehicles
- Selection state indicators across different views
- Active selection confirmation through visual cues
- Clear indication when no vehicle is selected

### Context-Sensitive Operations
- Selected vehicle determines available operations
- Context menu options based on selected vehicle state
- Action button availability based on selection
- Route and detail display for selected vehicles

### Save System Integration
- Persistent storage of selected vehicle state
- Selection restoration on game load
- Handling of invalid selections after load
- Selection preference management

## Acceptance Criteria

### Selection Consistency
- ✅ Vehicle selection state is consistent across all interfaces
- ✅ Selection changes propagate immediately to all views
- ✅ Only one vehicle can be selected at a time
- ✅ Selection state persists during interface navigation

### Visual Feedback
- ✅ Selected vehicle is clearly highlighted in all views
- ✅ Selection indicators are distinctive and professional
- ✅ No-selection state is clearly communicated
- ✅ Selection changes provide immediate visual feedback

### User Experience
- ✅ Vehicle selection feels responsive and immediate
- ✅ Selection methods are intuitive across different interfaces
- ✅ Context-sensitive operations reflect selection appropriately
- ✅ Selection persistence enhances workflow continuity

### System Integration
- ✅ Selection integrates properly with all vehicle systems
- ✅ Save system maintains selection state correctly
- ✅ Selection events trigger appropriate system responses
- ✅ Performance remains stable with selection operations

## Technical Notes

### Component Structure
```
VehicleSelection/
├── VehicleSelectionManager.cs (centralized selection management)
├── MapSelectionHandler.cs (map-based selection)
├── ListSelectionHandler.cs (list-based selection)
├── SelectionRenderer.cs (visual feedback)
└── SelectionPersistence.cs (save integration)
```

### Selection State Management
```
VehicleSelectionState:
- SelectedVehicleId: Currently selected vehicle identifier
- SelectionSource: Interface that initiated selection
- SelectionTime: Timestamp of selection
- PreviousSelection: Previous vehicle for navigation
- SelectionContext: Additional selection metadata
```

### Selection Event System
```
SelectionEvents:
- OnVehicleSelected(VehicleId, SelectionSource)
- OnVehicleDeselected(VehicleId)
- OnSelectionChanged(PreviousVehicle, NewVehicle)
- OnSelectionCleared()
```

### Visual Feedback System
- Map marker highlighting with special border/glow
- List item highlighting with background color change
- Selection indicator icons and badges
- Animation effects for selection changes

### Context Operations
- Route display for selected moving vehicles
- Detail panels for selected vehicle information
- Action buttons enabled based on vehicle state
- Map focus and zoom to selected vehicle

## Dependencies
- Requires Phase 8C (Vehicle Positioning) for map integration
- Requires Phase 7A (Vehicles View Window) for list integration
- Requires Phase 1D (Save System) for selection persistence

## Integration Points
- Map system handles vehicle marker selection
- Vehicle list provides alternative selection method
- Vehicle detail systems display selected vehicle information
- Action systems use selection for operation context

## Notes

### Selection Methods
- **Map Click**: Direct clicking on vehicle markers
- **List Selection**: Clicking vehicles in list interface
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys for selection cycling
- **Search Selection**: Selecting from search results
- **Context Selection**: Automatic selection from operations

### Selection Priority Rules
- Latest selection always takes precedence
- Invalid selections automatically cleared
- Selection preserved through interface changes
- Fallback to no selection for error states

### Visual Highlighting Specifications
- **Map Marker**: Glowing border with theme accent color
- **List Item**: Background highlight with selected state
- **Detail Panels**: Header emphasis for selected vehicle
- **Action Buttons**: Enabled state with selection context

### Selection Persistence Logic
- Selected vehicle ID stored in game preferences
- Selection restored on game load if vehicle still exists
- Invalid selections gracefully handled with clearance
- Selection preferences maintained across sessions

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient selection state propagation
- Optimized visual feedback rendering
- Minimal overhead for selection operations
- Fast selection change response time

### Accessibility Features
- Keyboard navigation for vehicle selection
- Screen reader announcements for selection changes
- High contrast selection indicators
- Focus management for selection operations

### Error Handling
- **Vehicle Not Found**: Clear selection and notify user
- **Invalid Selection**: Fallback to no selection
- **System Errors**: Maintain stable selection state
- **Network Issues**: Preserve local selection state

### Testing Requirements
- Test selection consistency across all interfaces
- Verify selection persistence through save/load cycles
- Test performance with large vehicle fleets
- Validate accessibility features for selection
- Test error handling with invalid selection scenarios
