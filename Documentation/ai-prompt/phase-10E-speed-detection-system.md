### Speed Detection Algorithm
```
SpeedDetection:
- MonitoringRadius: 150 units from checkpoint
- MeasurementDistance: 100 units for speed averaging
- SampleRate: 10 samples per second for accuracy
- ToleranceThreshold: 5 km/h grace period
- ViolationMinimum: Sustained violation for 2+ seconds
```

### Violation Detection Data
```
ViolationData:
- VehicleId: Vehicle being monitored
- CheckpointId: Enforcement checkpoint
- SpeedLimit: Posted speed limit at location
- DetectedSpeed: Average speed in violation zone
- ViolationAmount: Speed excess over limit
- ViolationTime: Timestamp of violation detection
- ViolationSeverity: Classification of violation level
```

### Fine Calculation Formula
```
FineCalculation:
- BaseSpeedLimit: Checkpoint speed limit
- ViolationSpeed: Average detected speed
- SpeedExcess: ViolationSpeed - BaseSpeedLimit - Tolerance
- BaseFine: 100 credits minimum fine
- SeverityMultiplier: 1.0 + (SpeedExcess / 10) * 0.25
- RepeatOffenderBonus: +50% for recent violations
- FinalFine = BaseFine * SeverityMultiplier * RepeatBonus
```

### Detection Zone System
- Warning Zone: 300 units before checkpoint (speed limit display)
- Monitoring Zone: 150 units around checkpoint (speed tracking)
- Measurement Zone: 100 units for violation detection
- Enforcement Zone: 50 units for fine processing

### Violation Severity Levels
```
ViolationSeverity:
- Minor: 5-15 km/h over limit (base fine)
- Moderate: 15-25 km/h over limit (1.5x fine)
- Serious: 25-35 km/h over limit (2.0x fine)
- Severe: 35+ km/h over limit (3.0x fine)
```

## Dependencies

## Notes

### Speed Detection Process
1. Monitor vehicles entering checkpoint detection radius
2. Begin speed tracking and averaging calculations
3. Compare average speed to posted speed limit
4. Apply tolerance threshold and violation detection
5. Calculate violation severity and fine amount
6. Trigger enforcement event and fine processing
7. Log violation data and update statistics
8. Notify player of violation and fine

### Warning System Implementation
